# Indicators_Chicago_2015-2025

This repository contains a data-driven analysis of public safety and institutional accountability trends in Chicago using publicly available administrative and survey data. The analysis examines conditions over the period 2015–2025, enabling comparison of longer-run historical patterns and more recent developments in citywide outcomes.

Rather than evaluating specific programs or attributing causal effects to individual policies, the repository organizes data into thematic indicator buckets that reflect widely recognized drivers of public safety and community wellbeing, including exposure to violence, institutional accountability, and post-incident outcomes.

Key components include:

Incident-level analysis of fatal and non-fatal shooting victimization

Spatial analysis of violence using ZIP-code–level aggregation and interactive choropleth maps

Trend analysis of publicly available oversight and accountability indicators

Reproducible workflows for data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and export

All analysis is descriptive and exploratory, intended to support transparency, contextual understanding, and further research rather than policy evaluation or causal inference.
